  - Buttons should scale slightly on hover
  - Checkboxes should have smooth check animations
  - List items should have hover effects

## Performance Testing
1. **Frame Rate**: All animations should maintain 60fps
2. **Battery Usage**: Animations should not significantly impact battery life on mobile devices
3. **Memory Usage**: Animations should not cause memory leaks

## Accessibility Testing
1. **Reduced Motion**: Animations should respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
2. **Screen Readers**: Animations should not interfere with screen reader functionality
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: All animated elements should be accessible via keyboard

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Chrome on Desktop
- [ ] Firefox on Desktop
- [ ] Safari on Desktop
- [ ] Edge on Desktop
- [ ] Mobile Chrome on Android
- [ ] Mobile Safari on iOS
- [ ] Tablet in Portrait mode
- [ ] Tablet in Landscape mode
- [ ] Mobile in Portrait mode
- [ ] Mobile in Landscape mode
- [ ] Performance testing completed

## Troubleshooting
1. **Animations not working**: Check browser compatibility and JavaScript errors
2. **Choppy animations**: Reduce animation complexity or duration
3. **High CPU usage**: Optimize animations to use `transform` and `opacity` properties

## Optimization Notes
1. All animations use CSS transitions and keyframes for performance
2. Hardware acceleration is enabled through `transform` properties
3. Animations are optimized for mobile devices
4. Fallbacks are provided for older browsers
